# Î±-AGI Insight v1

This directory hosts the static Î±â€‘AGI Insight demo used in the documentation. Build the docs with `mkdocs build` and open `alpha_agi_insight_v1/index.html` from the generated `site/` folder. To preview the files directly from the repository, run:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory docs/alpha_agi_insight_v1 8000
```

and navigate to <http://localhost:8000/>. Direct `file://` access is unsupported due to browser security restrictions.

**Live demo:** <https://montreal-ai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_agi_insight_v1/>

The projectâ€™s GitHub Pages site redirects its root URL to this directory for
convenience. Nonâ€‘technical users can simply open
<https://montreal-ai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/> and they will be forwarded
to the demo automatically.

For details on publishing the site automatically, see [Quick Deployment](../HOSTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md#quick-deployment).

### Prerequisites

* **Python â‰¥3.11**
* **Node.js â‰¥20** (checked via `node build/version_check.js`)
* **MkDocs**

## One-Command Build

Run the helper script to build the Insight progressive web app (PWA) and generate the `site/` directory:

```bash
./scripts/build_insight_docs.sh
```

The script installs Node dependencies, builds the browser bundle and runs `mkdocs build`. When executed in CI, it also publishes the resulting `site/` directory to GitHub Pages.
The bundled site registers a service worker so the demo remains available offline once loaded. The PWA now ships with a fully functional service worker. Ensure both `lib/workbox-sw.js` and `manifest.json` are present in the docs directoryâ€”these files enable caching. The service worker fetches `lib/workbox-sw.js` relative to `index.html`, so keep the file under `lib/`. Serve the files with a simple HTTP server (e.g. `python -m http.server`) so the service worker can register; opening `index.html` directly with `file://` will not work.

Preview the generated site locally with:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory site 8000
```

For convenience, run `./scripts/preview_insight_docs.sh` to build the demo and immediately serve it on `http://localhost:8000/`.

The [`ðŸ“š Docs` workflow](../../.github/workflows/docs.yml) runs the same script and publishes the contents of `site/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

### Testing offline mode

To verify that the PWA works without an internet connection:

1. Run `./scripts/preview_insight_docs.sh`. The script builds the docs, starts a
   local server and automatically launches a headless browser with Playwright.
   It waits for the service worker to register, disables network access and
   reloads the page. The command exits with an error if the page fails to load
   offline.
2. Alternatively, build the documentation with `./scripts/build_insight_docs.sh`
   and serve the `site/` directory locally:
   `python -m http.server --directory site 8000`.
3. Open <http://localhost:8000/> in a browser.
4. After the page loads, disable your network connection and reload.
   The demo should still display correctly.
5. If the page does not load offline, open your browser's developer console
   and inspect any service worker errors. Confirm `lib/workbox-sw.js` and
   `manifest.json` are served next to `index.html`.
Contributors are encouraged to run this check before publishing changes.
