    <!-- AGI Capability Curve Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>AGI Capability Growth Curve</h2>
      <p>
        This chart shows the projected <em>AGI capability index</em> (T<sub>AGI</sub>) over the next five years. 
        As AGI evolves, its effective ‚Äúintelligence temperature‚Äù rises. When this capability crosses certain thresholds, 
        it triggers phase transitions in various industries. The curve below illustrates this accelerating growth, 
        providing a timeline for when AGI is expected to reach disruptive levels.

    <!-- Sector Disruption Timeline Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Sector Disruption Timeline</h2>
      <p>
        The following visualization tracks six critical sectors and highlights the moment each is disrupted by AGI-driven innovation. 
        Each sector‚Äôs performance remains relatively stable until a sudden <strong>‚Äújump‚Äù</strong> occurs (marked by a star ‚≠ê on the line), 
        indicating an AGI-induced phase transition. These jump markers correspond to the points in time when 
        <strong>T<sub>AGI</sub></strong> becomes high enough to overcome the sector‚Äôs resistance or entropy, 
        fundamentally changing the sector‚Äôs trajectory. Decision-makers who anticipate these jumps can secure a major first-mover advantage.

    <!-- Pareto Frontier Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Pareto Frontier of Evolved Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Œ±‚ÄëAGI Insight employs a Meta-Agentic Tree Search (an NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm) that generates and evaluates numerous strategic scenarios. 
        Each scenario (point in the plot) is assessed on multiple objectives ‚Äì for example, <em>economic impact</em> (projected value creation) vs. <em>time to disruption</em>. 
        The <strong>Pareto frontier</strong> (highlighted in the chart) represents the optimal trade-offs where no objective can improve without worsening another. 
        In simpler terms, points on this frontier are the most efficient solutions balancing reward and risk (or speed), whereas interior points are suboptimal. 
        By exploring this frontier, stakeholders can identify strategies that maximize returns while minimizing time or risk.

      <h2>Agent Orchestrator Logs <small>(Optional)</small></h2>
      <p>
        The log below captures a simplified sequence of actions from the meta-agent orchestrator and its team of specialized agents during the Insight simulation. 
        It provides a narrative of how the forecast is constructed step-by-step ‚Äì from initial planning to strategy formulation and validation. 
        (You can hide or show the log as needed.)
