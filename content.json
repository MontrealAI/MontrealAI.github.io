TensorFlow HubReusing Machine Learning Modules TensorFlow Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A module is a self-contained piece of a TensorFlow graph, along with its weights and assets, that can be reused across different tasks in a process known as transfer learning. Transfer learning can: Train a model with a smaller dataset ; Improve generalization: and Speed up training. “ I think transfer learning is the key to general intelligence. And I think the key to doing transfer learning will be the acquisition of conceptual knowledge that is abstracted away from perceptual details of where you learned it from. “ — Demis Hassabis TensorFlow Hub Introducing TensorFlow Hub by Josh Gordon Transform your Web Site with an AI AgentFully-fledged AI systems can achieve serious revenue!

Deep LearningDeep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn REPRESENTATIONS of (raw) data with multiple levels of abstraction. At a high-level, neural networks are either encoders, decoders, or a combination of both. “DL is essentially a new style of programming–”differentiable programming”–and the field is trying to work out the reusable constructs in this style. We have some: convolution, pooling, LSTM, GAN, VAE, memory units, routing units, etc.“ — Thomas G. Dietterich 1.1 Neural Networks “Neural networks” are a sad misnomer.

Neural Networks + Gradient Descent + GPU: Infinitely flexible function: Neural Networks (multiple hidden layers: Deep Learning) ; All-purpose parameter fitting: Backpropagation ; and Fast and scalable: GPU. When a choice must be made, just feed the (raw) data to a deep neural network (universal function approximator). 1.2 Convolution Neural NetworkIn images, local combinations of edges form motifs, motifs assemble into parts, and parts form objects. The deep convolutional network, inspired by Hubel and Wiesel’s seminal work on early visual cortex, uses hierarchical layers of tiled convolutional filters to mimic the effects of receptive fields, thereby exploiting the local spatial correlations present in images. A ConvNet is made up of Layers. Every Layer has a simple API: It transforms an input 3D volume to an output 3D volume with some differentiable function that may or may not have parameters. “I admire the elegance of your method of computation; it must be nice to ride through these fields upon the horse of true mathematics while the like of us have to make our way laboriously on foot.“ — A.

Unsupervised learning is a paradigm for creating AI that learns without a particular task in mind: learning for the sake of learning. It captures some characteristics of the joint distribution of the observed random variables (learn the underlying structure). Self-supervised learning is derived form unsupervised learning where the data provides the supervision. 1.5.1 Generative Adversarial NetworkSimultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. $$\\min_{\\theta_g} \\max_{\\theta_d} [{\\rm IE_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}} [log D_{\\theta_d}(x)] + {\\rm IE_{z\\sim p_z(z)}} [log(1 - D_{\\theta_d}(G_{\\theta_g}(z)))]]$$ “What I cannot create, I do not understand.“ — Richard Feynman This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game.

And I think the key to doing transfer learning will be the acquisition of conceptual knowledge that is abstracted away from perceptual details of where you learned it from.“ — Demis Hassabis 2. Autonomous AgentsReinforcement learning (RL) studies how an agent can learn how to achieve goals in a complex, uncertain environment. An autonomous agent is any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. At the bleeding edge of AI, autonomous agents can learn from experience, simulate worlds and orchestrate meta-solutions. Here’s an informal definition of the universal intelligence of agent `\\pi` $$\\Upsilon(\\pi) := \\sum\\limits_{\\mu \\in E} 2^{-K(\\mu)} V^{\\pi}_{\\mu}$$ “Intelligence measures an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.“ — Shane Legg 2.1 Evolution Strategies “Evolution is a slow learning algorithm that with the sufficient amount of compute produces a human brain.“ — Wojciech Zaremba Evolution and neural networks proved a potent combination in nature. Natural evolutionary strategy directly evolves the weights of a DNN and performs competitively with the best deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Neuroevolution enables capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches.

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. A meta-learning algorithm takes in a distribution of tasks, where each task is a learning problem, and it produces a quick learner — a learner that can generalize from a small number of examples.

Deep LearningDeep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn REPRESENTATIONS of (raw) data with multiple levels of abstraction. At a high-level, neural networks are either encoders, decoders, or a combination of both. “DL is essentially a new style of programming–”differentiable programming”–and the field is trying to work out the reusable constructs in this style. We have some: convolution, pooling, LSTM, GAN, VAE, memory units, routing units, etc.“ — Thomas G. Dietterich 1.1 Neural Networks “Neural networks” are a sad misnomer.

Neural Networks + Gradient Descent + GPU: Infinitely flexible function: Neural Networks (multiple hidden layers: Deep Learning) ; All-purpose parameter fitting: Backpropagation ; and Fast and scalable: GPU. When a choice must be made, just feed the (raw) data to a deep neural network (universal function approximator). 1.2 Convolution Neural NetworkIn images, local combinations of edges form motifs, motifs assemble into parts, and parts form objects. The deep convolutional network, inspired by Hubel and Wiesel’s seminal work on early visual cortex, uses hierarchical layers of tiled convolutional filters to mimic the effects of receptive fields, thereby exploiting the local spatial correlations present in images. A ConvNet is made up of Layers. Every Layer has a simple API: It transforms an input 3D volume to an output 3D volume with some differentiable function that may or may not have parameters. “I admire the elegance of your method of computation; it must be nice to ride through these fields upon the horse of true mathematics while the like of us have to make our way laboriously on foot.“ — A.

Unsupervised learning is a paradigm for creating AI that learns without a particular task in mind: learning for the sake of learning. It captures some characteristics of the joint distribution of the observed random variables (learn the underlying structure). Self-supervised learning is derived form unsupervised learning where the data provides the supervision. 1.5.1 Generative Adversarial NetworkSimultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. $$\\min_{\\theta_g} \\max_{\\theta_d} [{\\rm IE_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}} [log D_{\\theta_d}(x)] + {\\rm IE_{z\\sim p_z(z)}} [log(1 - D_{\\theta_d}(G_{\\theta_g}(z)))]]$$ “What I cannot create, I do not understand.“ — Richard Feynman This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game.

And I think the key to doing transfer learning will be the acquisition of conceptual knowledge that is abstracted away from perceptual details of where you learned it from.“ — Demis Hassabis 2. Autonomous AgentsReinforcement learning (RL) studies how an agent can learn how to achieve goals in a complex, uncertain environment. An autonomous agent is any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. At the bleeding edge of AI, autonomous agents can learn from experience, simulate worlds and orchestrate meta-solutions. Here’s an informal definition of the universal intelligence of agent `\\pi` $$\\Upsilon(\\pi) := \\sum\\limits_{\\mu \\in E} 2^{-K(\\mu)} V^{\\pi}_{\\mu}$$ “Intelligence measures an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.“ — Shane Legg 2.1 Evolution Strategies “Evolution is a slow learning algorithm that with the sufficient amount of compute produces a human brain.“ — Wojciech Zaremba Evolution and neural networks proved a potent combination in nature. Natural evolutionary strategy directly evolves the weights of a DNN and performs competitively with the best deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Neuroevolution enables capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches.

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. A meta-learning algorithm takes in a distribution of tasks, where each task is a learning problem, and it produces a quick learner — a learner that can generalize from a small number of examples.
