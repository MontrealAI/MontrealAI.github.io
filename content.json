At the forefront of AI, deploying superhuman agents that can learn from experience in the browser unlocks new powerful possibilities to apply AI in ways we never thought of! E.g., on a mobile device, the autonomous agent can leverage sensor data (i.e.: gyroscope or accelerometer) and take actions. True understanding comes from agents that learn by “seeing” how they affect the world. All data stays on the client, making AI agents in the browser useful for privacy preserving applications. “ Artificial Intelligence is about recognising patterns, Artificial Life is about creating patterns. “ — Mizuki Oka et al, #alife2018 A Proof of Concept : Getting Alexa to Respond to Sign LanguageUsing TensorFlow to make an Amazon Echo respond to sign language, by M. A. Singh : Blog Post by by M. A. Singh Code for the Proof of Concept on GitHub Advanced and Impactful Open-Source TechnologiesBringing contributions by scholars recognized as the foremost authorities in their fields, Montréal Artificial Intelligence is ahead of trends that will profoundly influence the future of Humanity. Cutting edge open-source technologies proudly used : 1. TensorFlow.jsTraining and Deploying ML Models in the Browser TensorFlow.js uses flexible and intuitive APIs to build and train models from scratch using a low-level JavaScript linear algebra library or a high-level layers API. The TensorFlow.js model converters allows running pre-existing TensorFlow models right in the browser or under Node.js. Pre-existing ML models can be retrained using sensor data connected to the browser, or other client-side data. Three development workflows : Importing an existing, pre-trained model for inference ; Re-training an imported model quickly (transfer learning) with only a small amount of data ; and Authoring (define, train, and run) models directly in the browser. TensorFlow.js AI agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods. There’s no need to install anything. Just open a webpage, and your AI Agent is ready to run.

Reinforcement LearningGoing Beyond Input-Output Pattern Recognition In the past few years deep reinforcement learning started achieving state-of-the-art results. “ Reinforcement learning (RL) is the subfield of machine learning concerned with decision making and motor control. It studies how an agent can learn how to achieve goals in a complex, uncertain environment. “ — OpenAI At the bleeding edge of AI, autonomous agents can learn from experience, simulate worlds and orchestrate meta-solutions. Here’s an inspiring example of a high-quality implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm : Powerful and useful application domains : Dialogue, Healthcare, Management, Robotics, Smart Grid, Supply Chains, etc. “ Self-Play is Automated Knowledge Creation. “ — Carlos E. Perez References : OpenAI Gym by OpenAI OpenAI Baselines by OpenAI AlphaGo Zero: Learning from scratch by DeepMind A Visual Guide to Evolution Strategies by David Ha OpenAI Five by OpenAI 3. TensorFlow HubReusing Machine Learning Modules TensorFlow Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A module is a self-contained piece of a TensorFlow graph, along with its weights and assets, that can be reused across different tasks in a process known as transfer learning. Transfer learning can: Train a model with a smaller dataset ; Improve generalization: and Speed up training. “ I think transfer learning is the key to general intelligence. And I think the key to doing transfer learning will be the acquisition of conceptual knowledge that is abstracted away from perceptual details of where you learned it from. “ — Demis Hassabis TensorFlow Hub Introducing TensorFlow Hub by Josh Gordon Transform your Web Site with an AI AgentFully-fledged AI systems can achieve serious revenue! Montréal Artificial Intelligence helps to transform Web sites for the age of artificial intelligence by developing machine learning agents in the browser that achieves goal-oriented behavior.

aerospace industry hub and a world leader in artificial intelligence, we’ve created Montréal.AI Space.“ — Vincent Boucher, B. Sc. Physics, M. A. Policy Analysis and M. Sc. Aerospace Engineering (Space Technology), Founding Chairman at Montréal.AI Montréal.AI Space has a Jewel status in the Montréal.AI Portfolio. “What I cannot create, I do not understand.“ — Richard Feynman Montréal.AI Space : Solving Humanity’s Toughest ChallengesWe are at the verge of a global technological shift. Montréal.AI Space leverages aerospace engineering, applied artificial intelligence and space science researches for use in spaceflight, satellites, and space exploration on an unprecedented scale. “Any Sufficiently Advanced Technology is Indistinguishable from Magic.“ — Arthur C. Clarke Montréal.AI Space : Exploring the Stars and the UniverseWe are living in a period of unprecedented breakthroughs in science. Near future advances at the intersection of aerospace engineering and artificial intelligence hold out extraordinary prospects for the future of Mankind. “Artificial Intelligence is about recognising patterns, Artificial Life is about creating patterns.“ — Mizuki Oka et al, #alife2018 Montréal.AI Space believes in enhancing Humanity’s well-being by leveraging superintelligence to explore the Stars : The place where we truly belong. With higher ingenuity, we implements world‐class agents to design breakthrough deep learning algorithms with an understanding of our Universe. “I think transfer learning is the key to general intelligence. And I think the key to doing transfer learning will be the acquisition of conceptual knowledge that is abstracted away from perceptual details of where you learned it from.“ — Demis Hassabis Montréal.AI’s superhuman AI agents can learn from experience, simulate worlds and orchestrate meta-solutions. A new powerful model for a large number of emerging superintelligence giants spreading across a landscape. Montréal.AI Space is offering a new world age of impactful technical prowesses on a truly global scale. “Of course, particle physicists are among the first to realize that nature is compositional.“ — Yann LeCun References Why does deep and cheap learning work so well? — Henry W.
